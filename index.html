            <h2>My name is Johanna,</h2>
            <p>in September 2022 I completed the three-months bootcamp at neuefische GmbH to become a web developer.<br>
              Before I decided to do the bootcamp, I was dedicated to horses and worked with them for round about four years.<br>
              After living in Ireland for two months, Corona spreaded and I had to come back to Germany. I had to get another job quickly, so I started work as an assistant of a physician at a doctor's office.
              Through some projects with a friend, I was reminded of how much I enjoyed coding during my design assistant vocational training. That's when I started refreshing my knowledge and coding skills. The bootcamp was a great opportunity to start from.
              <br><strong>So here I am.</strong></p>
